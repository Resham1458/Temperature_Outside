Objective:
The objective of the project is to design a program which finds out the degree of hotness or coldness of outside temperature, respective to the user input temperature by using a Python Programming Language. 

Task: 
1)	Ask the user what outside temperature is
2)	Print out “It is warm outside” if the temperature is greater than 60 degrees but less than 90 degrees
3)	Print out “It is hot outside” if the temperature is 90 degrees or greater
4)	Print out “It is chilly outside” if the temperature is under 60 degrees

Process: 
1)	User is asked to enter the outside temperature
2)	If the temperature is greater than 60 degrees but less than 90 degrees, “It is warm outside” is printed
3)	If the temperature is 90 degrees or greater, “It is hot outside” is printed
4)	If the temperature is under 60 degrees, “It is chilly outside” is printed
